# Capstone Project: Spark Streaks PWA

Spark Streaks is an app designed to help people manage their personal goals. The app integrates meaningful incentive techniques such as tracking streaks of activities and fun collectable rewards.

I first came up with this idea as incentive to make myself do core exercises, an activity that I felt I should do on a regular basis but rarely found motivation to do on my own. Personally, I find simple motivational techniques such as streaks and badges very effective. I have used them before in apps such as Duolingo and Garmin with successful results. However, most apps that use these techniques are targeted at a specific type of goal with specific requirements. I wanted to create an app that allowed for more flexibility and could be used for any type of goal. Spark Streaks also puts a twist on the common badge reward system of motivational apps. The badges take the form of collectable characters, an idea taken from games I liked to play as a kid.  

Spark Streaks is in the form of a progressive web app (PWA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Firebase as the app’s database and hosting server. I chose to create Spark Streaks as a PWA because it seemed like the most convenient and accessible platform. PWAs work on both Apple and Android devices and do not require a device-specific language to create. Additionally, PWAs have many of the same capabilities as native apps as they can be saved to the device’s home screen and used online. There are some downsides as PWAs are still relatively new and have not been fully accepted by some platforms. However, all the main components are widely supported and the missing components were not necessary for my app.

The project consisted of 5 main stages, each of which is described in more detail below.

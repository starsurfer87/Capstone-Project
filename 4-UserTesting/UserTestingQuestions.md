# User Testing Questions
## Intro:
- Thanks for agreeing to do this user test. We can stop the test at any time.
- The basic purpose of the app is to track a streak for repeating goals or habit and provide and reward system which motivates users to complete these goals.
- This is just a prototype, so there are some limitations. Essentially, this is just a series of images you can click through in order to imitate an app. As a result, any fillable sections will be automatically filled when you click on them.
- There are no right or wrong answers. I’m testing the app not you. I welcome any feedback you have.
## Process Instructions:
1.	You want to set up your first goal streak. You want this goal to repeat every week on Mondays and Wednesdays.
2.	You have achieved your goal for the day and want to indicate this in the app. 
3.	You want to set up another goal streak. This time you want your goal to repeat every day.
4.	You want to view all your current goals. (Some other goals have been added for the sake of testing.) You want to see the details for your “Core Exercises” goal. Do you understand the meaning of all the information on this page?
5.	You want to view all of you past goals. (Some other goals have been added for the sake of testing.) You are curious about the results of your “Stretching Goal”.
6.	You want to reward yourself by unlocking one of the badges. You decide to choose a badge from the original collection.
## Overall Feedback:
1.	Were the purposes of the app’s functions clear?
2.	Did you have difficulty navigating or using any of the pages? Is there anything you think could be changed to improve navigation and usability?
3.	Do you have any feedback about the goal completion user interface?
